          Yes, we don’t look like a dental practice and that’s totally on

        Our lounge is intimate and comfortable so you’ll feel right at home. Our
        front office team is not hiding behind a high desk and you won’t see
        piles of paper or archives, we’re a clean and paperless practice, no
        visual pollution here. Check ins are fully digital and synchronised and
        if you’ve filled out our medical form from home you won’t have to do a
        thing, just relax.

        Most likely you won’t have to wait too much but if you do take advantage
        of a chilled glass of water or make yourself at home and grab a chilled
        lemonade from our minibar. Or better yet, just warm up to a freshly
        ground Zaraffas coffee from our machine. You’ll almost wish we run
        behind.

        At Proud Smile relaxation is taken seriously as we understand a lot of
        our patients are usually in fear or nervous. The famous dentist smell
        was replaced by beautiful scents throughout the whole clinic, usually
        found on department stores.

        Large TV`s in our ceiling just above our treatment chairs means you can
        watch Netflix and your favourite shows laying back while we work on your
        teeth. We provide noise cancelling headphones which will quite the
        sounds around you. Only thing we can`t do is popcorn.

        Exclusively to our clinic we`ve installed coloured LED lighting in our
        treatment rooms. You`ll probably have seen these in airplanes and
        research shows that our mood is greatly influenced by certain lighting.
        As a general rule we are more relaxed when there`s less light so our
        whole practice has dimmed lighting throughout. Shades of purple or pink
        will set the mood for relaxation for when we`re treating you and blue or
        green feels refreshing at the end of your treatment. A warm towel to
        refresh your face just adds the final touch.

          Technology is often associated with things non human but for us here
          we believe in using it to our advantage to increase focus on patient
          care.<br /><br />
          Our recent investment in digital technology could easily be considered
          a water divider between old and new dentistry and it has changed the
          way we do dentistry forever.

          Instead of the old style rubber moulds we can now scan your teeth
          using state of the art 3D scanners and then from there we can produce
          a myriad of different types of restorations and appliances with nearly
          100% precision and completely outside the mouth. Less work inside the
          mouth means new heights of comfort, never seen before. You’ll be truly
          amazed at what we can do but most importantly at how little we need to
          do in your mouth.
